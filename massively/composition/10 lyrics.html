<pre><code>[Masquerade]

In quiet times
Kept mask hides true self
Removing it our bond unties
Freely I want to dance

Behind it lies a truth
The days I spend with you
Just want to tell what is inside
But unable to set it free

Heading for exit
Searching for a key
To make me feel free
Masked it's hazy near

I am lost, can't find the way
Scared to step into the day
I stay where shadows sway
Longing for a brighter ray

こみ上げて
声が枯れくらいに
何度も繰り返したい
衝動に駆られて

だけど押し殺して
中に秘めたままで
Just want to tell what is inside
But unable to set it free

Heading for exit
Searching for a key
To make me feel free
Masked it's hazy near

I am lost, can't find the way
Scared to step into the day
I stay where shadows sway
Longing for a brighter ray

In silence rain
I stay alone
Scream inside
Echoes fade away

In silence rain
I stay alone
Scream inside
Echoes fade away


Heading for exit
Searching for a key
To make me feel free
Masked it's hazy near

I am lost, can't find the way
Scared to step into the day
I stay where shadows sway
Longing for a brighter ray
