<pre><code>[Breath of Life]

Stopping where sunlight
Sets the trees' leaves aglow
Just wanna take a deeper deeper breath
White snow's melting
And water's dripping
A warm wind's blowing blowing

Looking at the bright skies
I've never felt like this
Seeing wondrous beauty the earth has bestowed
Wanna soar through the sky 
With wings made of gold
Just wanna close my eyes

I know my truth
I am who I am
I know what I do
Better than anyone 

I am not perfect
But I live every moment
And I'm singing tonight
That's just my life, my life

目をさまして
出口探して
I had lost my way, my way yeah

読み漁って
解を求めて
気づけば stay up all night

握りしめた
手を胸に当てて
I repeat myself over and over again

ありのままで
歩む自分を
想像して
It's alright, it's alright

I know my truth
I am who I am
I know what I do
Better than anyone 

I am not perfect
But I live every moment
And I'm singing tonight
That's just my life, my life

Stopping where sunlight 
Sets the trees' leaves aglow
Just wanna take a deeper deeper breath

Looking at the bright skies
I've never felt like it
Just wanna close my eyes, my eyes

I know my truth
I am who I am
I know what I do
Better than anyone 

I am not perfect
But I live every moment
And I'm singing tonight
That's just my life, my life

I know my truth
I am who I am
I know what I do
Better than anyone 

I am not perfect
But I live every moment
And I'm singing tonight
That's just my life, my life
