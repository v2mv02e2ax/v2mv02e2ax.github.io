<pre><code>[Fearful Storms]

Regrettin' all my regrets
As if my time just took a sudden pause
Oh I forget so many things
Things not done still remain undone

Now that I'm caught in a swift stream
I'm not sure what to wish for
The rain is rainin' all around
Oh is anyone out there

You know
Failure is a steep hill
So climb it with a will
And failure is a dark night
So expect the bright light
And failure is a black coal
So fuse it to a diamond soul
And be afraid that you didn't
Give it a try

Even a small wind could turn into a fearful storm
Oh we're buildin' it up
And breakin' it down (break it down)
Even a small wind could turn into a fearful storm
So get on up
And hold your head high

All I can do (All I can do )
Is scream for you (Is screaming for you)
Don't run away (I'm not afraid)
Take my hand (Never look back)

Even a small wind could turn into a fearful storm
Oh we're buildin' it up
And breakin' it down (break it down)
